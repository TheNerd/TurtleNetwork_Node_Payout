# TurtleNetwork_Node_Payout
Automated payout script for TurtleNetwork node operators 

Based on <https://github.com/jansenmarc/WavesLPoSDistributer> but rewritten in Python.

Based on <https://github.com/iammortimer/TN_LPoS_Payout/> by iammortimer.

## Installation
This script uses Pyton version 3.

To install the required dependencies please run the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Now we need to configure the settings for the script. For this we need to edit the config.json file:
```
{
    "node": enter your node address, for example: "http://localhost:6862",
    "address" : enter the WE address of your node,
    "alias" : enter your nodes alias or leave empty,
    "excludeListTN" : array of excluded leasing address from payout, 
    "firstBlock" : first block to start cheching from (put it well before the first block you started your node on or just 1), 
    "startBlock" : starting block of the calculations (usually the endBlock from the last time it was run or 1 if it's the first time),
    "endBlock" : ending block for the calculations to run to (enter 0 if you want to use the current last block),
    "apikey" : enter your api key for use with swagger,
    "percentageOfFeesToDistribute" : percentage of fees you want to distribute to your lessers, 
    "minAmounttoPay" : minimum amount to pay to lessors,
    "blockStorage": filename to store the processed blocks in,
    "paymentStorage": filename to store the payments in,
    "attachmentText" : text you want to attach to the payment to your lessors,
    "doPayment" : enter 0 or 1, 0 will do a testrun of the payments, 1 will do the actual payments
}
```

Here's an example of a filled out file:
```
{
    "node": "http://192.168.16.214:6861",
    "address" : "3JfSdQxjJn8xReJ73LZg7FTfB6TaXG5qHot",
    "alias" : "mortys.node",
    "excludeListTN" : ["3JqAYiRnuiJxdMVmdTUsxuTV39LXHR5JWXk", "3Jhnxksci21hyiwZ2oKA6QNtXg8KrJctsQH"],
    "firstBlock" : 550000,
    "startBlock" : 1055996,
    "endBlock" : 1076311,
    "apikey" : "",
    "percentageOfFeesToDistribute" : 90, 
    "minAmounttoPay" : 0,
    "blockStorage": "blocks.json",
    "paymentStorage": "payments.json",
    "attachmentText" : "thank you for supporting Morty's node",
    "doPayment" : 1
}
```

## Execution
When you finished editing the config.json you are ready to run the script. This consists out of 2 (or 3) parts:
1. Create the payment file.
2. (this is optional) Do a testrun of the actual payment.
3. Do the payment

To create the payment file you need to execute calcPayments.py script:
```
python calcPayments.py
```
or
```
python3 calcPayments.py
```

It will show you what's happening. The saving of the block file could take a few minutes, so don't worry if it seems nothing is happening when it says 'saving blockfile...'.

### ------------ This is where things will start to change ------------
Once the script is completed (it will show you some statistics about this run, like forged blocks, number of leases, stuff like that) you can either do a testrun of the payment (set the doPayment in config.json to 0) or do the actual payment (set the doPayment in config.json to 1) by executing the following command:
```
python doPayments.py
```
or
```
python3 doPayments.py
```

And your done. 

After your first run make sure you set the startBlock in the config.json to the correct block you left off in your previous run.
